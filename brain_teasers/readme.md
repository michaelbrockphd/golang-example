# Old Brain Teasers

Basically coding exercises I still think of from my undergraduate days and other places.

Even though I know the solutions, I still think of them and wonder how I missed the obvious solutions.

## Count All Integer Values

A simple exercise where one has to as quickly as possible encounter all numbers from 0 to 2^31 at least once before exiting.

I still kick myself to this day at the solution.
